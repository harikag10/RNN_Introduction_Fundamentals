# Various Applications in RNN

Lets look at some of areas where RNNs are used extensively

#### Text generation <a id="Text-generation"></a>

Since language is sequentially organized with grammar and proper semantics, we highly rely on RNN predictive algorithms.

Text generation can be utilized for multiple purposes

* Text summarization

Condensing the original text into a distillation of critical points, widely used in project management during onboarding

* Document generation

Commonly used in banking and insurance for creating forms as per client's requests

* Report generation

#### Sentiment Analysis <a id="Sentiment-Analysis"></a>

#### Image classification and Image captioning <a id="Image-classification-and-Image-captioning"></a>

Used for classifying an image to a class, by learning through a set of features to the neural network and providing a caption to a given input image

#### Handwritten digit recognition and speech recognition <a id="Handwritten-digit-recognition-and-speech-recognition"></a>

Google alexa, Amazon echo, Apple siri are examples of speech recognition where machine understands the language and performed actions accordingly.

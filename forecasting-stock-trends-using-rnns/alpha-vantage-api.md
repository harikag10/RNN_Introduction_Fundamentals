# Alpha Vantage API

Alpha Vantage is powerful tool, a way to get access of real time stock quotes, historical data, cryptocurrencies and more.It provides APIs for stock market data and documentation of technical indicators. 

Alpha Vantage APIs are grouped into four categories: \(1\) Stock Time Series Data, \(2\) Physical and Digital/Crypto Currencies \(e.g., Bitcoin\), \(3\) Technical Indicators, and \(4\) Sector Performances. All APIs are realtime and the latest data points are derived from the current trading day

In our predictions, we are going to use the python module alpha\_vantage to get the stock data from the Alpha Vantage API.
